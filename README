## About

vim-symbols-strings is a plugin that converts Ruby symbols to strings and vice versa. It can be used in conjunction with vim operator commands.

## Usage

For now, the commands are frozen as follows:

* <Leader>g<movement modifiers> to convert symbols to strings - e.g. <Leader>gi( will convert all symbols inside parenthesis to strings
* <Leader>l<movement modifiers> to convert strings to symbols - e.g. <Leader>li( will convert all symbols inside parenthesis to strings

## Caveat Emptor

The definition of what constitutes a string or a symbol is fairly naive - I tend to use largely letters and underscores in symbols and so the regexps will only recognise those for conversion - am hoping that this covers most fo the use cases

## Installation

The easiest way to install this would be to use Pathogen and include the git repo as a git submodule in your bundle.
